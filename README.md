cAdvisor
-	Container Advisor provides container user an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers.
-	It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes and exports information about running containers.
-	Specifically, for each container it keeps resource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource usage and network statistics.
-	This data is exported by container and machine-wide.
-	cAdvisor scrapes information about containers inside the host system and send this data to the Prometheus.

Prometheus
-	Prometheus is a multi-dimensional data model.
-	Prometheus is a monitoring solution to collect metrics from several targets.
-	Time series collection happens by means of a pull model over http.
-	Prometheus is to query docker services on predefined metrics, create graphs, query database, to check health status of services. 
NodeExporter
-	The Node Exporter exposes the Prometheus metrics of the host machine in which it is running and shows the machineâ€™s file system, networking devices, processor, memory usages and others features as well.
-	Node exporter can be run as a docker container while reporting stats for the host system.
Grafana
-	Grafana which is a graphical interface with a dashboard that supports Prometheus as a back-end to query for the data to generate the graph.
-	Prometheus has a built-in graph features that can be access through its web interface but Grafana offers a much more powerful feature.
-	Grafana the face of Prometheus.
Now setup monitoring tolls.
Pre-request:
1.	Clone the YAML files form Github.

2.	You have installed these two pre-requisites
I.	Docker
II.	Docker swarm initialize on master node.
III.	Create docker network
# docker network create --driver=overlay monitor
Step-1: Install cAdvisor, append the following lines to the cAdviser.yml
